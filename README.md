# proto-type
HTML / JavaScript based prototype for a text editor that changes the text font depending on typing speed.

You can try it by launching the Node.js application (`node bin/www`) or opening [proto-type.html](proto-type.html).

If you type faster, the font will get less readable. The font is set separately for each word.
This is a prototype, it has bugs and does not have many features.
